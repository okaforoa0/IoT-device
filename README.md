The ClimaLED Temperature sensor IoT device is designed to measure the temperature in Celcius and convert it to Fahrenheit for easy interpretation. There are two LED indicators to provide real-time feedback by blinking in specific sequences to indicate whether the environment is too hot or cold based on predefined thresholds. This system offers a simple way to visually monitor and respond to changes in temperature.
