The ClimaLED Temperature sensor IoT device is designed to measure the temperature in Celcius and convert it to Fahrenheit for easy interpretation. There are two LED indicators to provide real-time feedback by blinking in specific sequences to indicate whether the environment is too hot or cold based on predefined thresholds. This system offers a simple way to visually monitor and respond to changes in temperature. 


***************************************************************************************************************
- Accomplished the development of ClimaLED IoT Temperature Sensor, by designing a temperature sensing device that measures in Celsius and converts to Fahrenheit, resulting in real-time feedback through LED indicators

- Connected the sensor data to Adafruit IO, by integrating the device with cloud-based monitoring and data visualization, resulting in seamless remote temperature tracking

- Created a custom circuit design using KiCad, by designing and implementing the schematic and PCB layout, resulting in a professionally manufactured board with a purple solder mask and white silkscreen

- Programmed the system with Arduino, by establishing serial communications, internet connection, and Adafruit IO data feeds, resulting in reliable data transmission and device functionality

- Configured real-time environmental monitoring, by coding specific LED blinking patterns to indicate different temperature thresholds, resulting in clear visual feedback for temperature changes
